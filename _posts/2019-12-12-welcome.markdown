My name is Colin Schepers and I'm a software engineer and problem solver during the day. During the night I'm an expert in sleeping. 

I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Knowledge Engineering from Maastricht University in 2010, and two years later I received my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. Since then I've been working as full-time software developer and researcher.

Check out my other resources for more information about me or my work.
