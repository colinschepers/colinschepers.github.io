This application aims at helping to beat [Hurdle](https://playhurdle.vercel.app) [1], which is
a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) [2]
meets [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) [3] game.
You can try out Hurdle Solver [here](https://share.streamlit.io/colinschepers/hurdlesolver).

## Gameplay

Hurdle is a slightly harder version of the game Wordle that became very popular last year. Like in Wordle, you need to
guess the five-letter word of the day, where each guess must be a valid word according to the game's dictionary.
After each guess you receive information similar to the game of Mastermind:

- the green tile indicates the number of correct characters in the correct position
- the yellow tile indicates the number of correct characters in the wrong position

For instance, if the word of the day is `CHESS`, the guess `CHASE` would be scored as `3` green and `1` yellow.

## Implementation

The application is written in python and uses only one dependency (Streamlit, see next section).
The vocabulary used by the solver class is a predefined list of around 5000 five-letter words [4].
For performance reasons, when there is no information about a game yet, the suggestions proposed by the solver is based
on a predefined list of 25 good starting words [5].

After providing information to the solver (i.e. the number of the green and yellow tiles given a guess), it will first
filter out all words that are not possible anymore. The remaining candidate words will be sorted using entropy [6].
It is the state of disorder, or randomness, of the resulting distribution of solutions after the particular guess.

For instance, consider the following guesses and their resulting distribution of possible solutions:

- Guess `CHASE`
    - `5` times `5` green and `0` yellow
    - `5` times `4` green and `1` yellow
- Guess `CLOSE`
    - `2` times `5` green and `0` yellow
    - `2` times `4` green and `1` yellow
    - `2` times `4` green and `0` yellow
    - `2` times `3` green and `2` yellow
    - `2` times `3` green and `1` yellow

The guess `CLOSE` has a higher entropy, and would therefore be a better guess. Regardless of which of the 5
options the game returns, you will always rule out 8 of the 10 possible words. The guess `CHASE` on the other hand 
would only cut the space in half.

## Graphical User Interface

The graphical user interface is build using the open-source tool [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) [7].
It provides a fast way to build and share data apps in pure python, and once youâ€™ve created an app you can use the
Community Cloud
platform to deploy, manage, and share the app.
