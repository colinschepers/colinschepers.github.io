Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of 
skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. Every day
from the first of December until the first day of Christmas a new challenge is released
in the website [1]. Some people use them for programming practice while others are using it 
as a speed contest or to challenge each other. 

Personally, I'm not interested in solving the puzzles as fast as possible (they are released
6 a.m. local time which is way too early for me anyway), but aim to create an algorithm 
that most efficiently solves the problem, while keeping the code as clean and readable as 
possible.
