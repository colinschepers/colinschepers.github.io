		My name is Colin Schepers and I’m a software engineer and problem solver during the day. During the night I’m an expert in sleeping. When I'm not behind my computer, I like to travel, play squash, go running, play video games and go to social events.

		I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Knowledge Engineering from Maastricht University in 2010, and two years later I received my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. I started working as full-time software developer and researcher at CX Company, where I developed a wide range of skills due to high expectations in deployability and flexibility; from C#, Python and JavaScript to RavenDB, MSSQL and Azure. I helped setting up the software platform DigitalCX from scratch, I learned to write quality code, create unit and integration tests, and experienced working together in a multicultural team. As part of the R&D team, I developed many small scale AI applications using algorithms in the field of Text Mining, NLP and Deep Learning.

		In 2020 I decided to start a new challenge at the Netherlands Forensic Institute in the Hague, where I would join the team Forensic Big Data Analysis. My educational background in AI and working experience in software development was put to test here, and I learned a lot from the skilled data scientists in my team. The projects I worked on included deep learning, AI, data science, data analysis, speech recognition, NLP, image detection, and more.

	    	During the course of my career I also worked on several side projects, individually or with friends. For fun, I also enjoy creating this website, the projects you can find on my github and solving programming challenges like <a href="https://www.codingame.com/">codingame</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.
