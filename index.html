		My name is Colin Schepers and I’m a software engineer and problem solver during the day. During the night I’m an expert in sleeping. When I'm not behind my computer, I like to travel, play squash, go running, play video games and go to social events.

		I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Knowledge Engineering from Maastricht University in 2010, and two years later I received my Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. Since then I’ve been working as full-time software developer and researcher. I'm currently working at CX Company where I developed a wide range of skills due to high expectations in deployability and flexibility; from C#, Python and JavaScript to RavenDB, MSSQL and Azure. I helped setting up the software platform DigitalCX from scratch, I learned to write quality code, create unit and integration tests, and experienced working together in a multicultural team. As part of the R&D team, I developed many small scale AI applications using algorithms in the field of Text Mining, NLP and Deep Learning. At home I worked on several side projects, individually and with some friends.
